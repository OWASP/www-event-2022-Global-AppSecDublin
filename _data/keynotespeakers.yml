  #subject: We Deserve Rights 
  #abstract: "Hackers have been mislabeled and treated as criminals due to socially constructed beliefs that have been pushed out by the public. In return, we face prosecution when doing our job and trying to keep the world safe from attackers. Current legislation has destroyed many lives of hackers who did not exploit and stayed within scope. In return, 1 out of 4 hackers don't submit vulnerabilities due to the ongoing fear of prosecution. This talk dives into the socially constructed beliefs that the world has towards hackers and how increasing public awareness is needed to change their mindset to update out-of-date legislation."
