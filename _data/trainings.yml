  URL: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-appsec-us-2021-virtual-training-tickets-188589806187
  SectionId: sku_KSM
  Description: >-
      Kubernetes has emerged as the leading container orchestration and management platform for on-prem and cloud environments. However, Kubernetes is a multi-headed beast with several minute and nuanced security configuration parameters. In addition, attackers take 
      advantage of these insecurely configured and designed Kubernetes deployments and perform deep-incursions into the organization’s assets. This training is a hard-core hands-on view of Kubernetes Security from an Attack and Defense perspective. The course takes the 
      participants through a journey where they start with setting up a Kubernetes cluster (simulating an on-prem Kubernetes) deployment, attack the cluster and learn, through multiple deep-dive examples and cookbooks on how they can effectively secure Kubernetes clusters. 
      The course is aimed at providing a view of attacking, auditing and defending Kubernetes clusters on-prem or on the cloud

  SectionId: sku_AWH
  Description: >-
    This is the latest edition of our threat modeling trainings released at Black Hat USA 2021, with a new threat modeling war game with red and blue threat modeling teams. Engaged in capture the flag style threat modeling challenges your team will battle for control over an offshore wind turbine park. Based on our experience in securing real-world Operational Technology (OT) infrastructure.
    Also, in this edition we enhanced the sections on agile and DevOps threat modeling, threat modeling and compliance, added a section on "threat modeling at scale" and all participants get our Threat Modeling Playbook plus one-year access to our online threat modeling training subscription.
    As highly skilled professionals, we know that there is a gap between academic knowledge of threat modeling and the real world. To minimize that gap, we developed practical Use Cases, based on real-life projects. Each use case includes a description of the environment, together with questions and templates to build a threat model. Using this methodology for the hands-on workshops we provide our students with a robust training experience and the templates to incorporate threat modeling best practices in their daily work.
    Students will be challenged in groups of 3 to 4 people to perform the different stages of threat modeling on the following<br>
    • Threat modeling an IoT gateway with a cloud-based update service<br>
    • Get into the defender's head – modeling points of attack against a nuclear facility<br>
    • Threat mitigations of OAuth scenarios for an HR application<br>
    • Privacy analysis of a new face recognition system in an airport<br>
    • Battle for control over "Zwarte Wind", an offshore wind turbine park<br>
    After each hands-on workshop, the results are discussed, and students receive a documented solution. Based on our successful trainings in the last years and the great and positive feedback, we released this updated advanced threat modeling training at Black Hat USA 2021.
    Some feedback from our Black Hat training attendees<br>
    • “Sebastien delivered! One of the best workshop instructor's I've ever had.”<br>
    • “Very nice training course, one of the best I ever attended.”<br>
    • “I feel that this course is one of the most important courses to be taken by a security professional.”<br>
    • “The group hands-on practical exercises truly helped.”<br>
    • “hands-on labs are very well designed, and the solutions are also very smart!”<br>

  Title: Browser Fingerprinting - Past, Present, and Future (1-day training course)
  URL: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-appsec-us-2021-virtual-training-tickets-188589806187
  SectionId: sku_BFPPF
  Description: >- 
     Browser fingerprinting refers to a website's ability to infer the exact makeup of a user's browsing environment and differentiate that user from other users without the use of cookies and other stateful identifiers. Constructively, browser fingerprinting has the potential to protect users and websites by detecting bots, and differentiating between benign users and attackers impersonating these users using stolen credentials. Destructively, browser fingerprinting can be used as an invasive way of tracking users across websites, even when users delete their cookies and use their browser's private mode. In this training, we will review the history of browser fingerprinting and see how it is different from traditional cookie-based user-identification techniques but also more intrusive stateful techniques, such as, evercookies and HSTS-based tracking. We will methodically investigate how browser fingerprinting works and what attributes can go into a browser fingerprint, ranging from JavaScript-based and browser-based properties, to attributes about the user's graphics card and even the TLS stack of their browser. We will understand how browser extensions can be fingerprinted and to what extent off-the-shelf tools that advertise anti-fingerprinting capabilities can really deliver on their promises. Next to learning about all modern browser-fingerprinting techniques, the participants will get an opportunity to actively learn via a number of hands-on activities that involve perusing the DOM of different browsers searching for browser-specific artifacts, understanding the architecture and operation of the most popular open-source fingerprinting library, observing how the TLS stacks of different browsers and web clients can be revealed through fingerprinting, and evaluate popular anti-fingerprinting tools. The participants of this training will be able to walk away with not just a concrete understanding of browser fingerprinting (and how they can avoid its unwanted variant as users on the web) but also with the knowledge to assess whether and how they can constructively use browser fingerprinting in the authentication and intrusion-detection components of their web applications.
     
     ### Outline:
     
     My intention with this training is to guide web developers and security researchers through the convoluted world of browser fingerprinting, helping them understand what it is, how it has evolved over the last ten years, and how it can be used to protect web applications (but also abused to track users). Below, I split the training in terms of curriculum and in terms of hands-on activities.

     #### Curriculum
       - What is browser fingerprinting?
         - High-level definition
         - Differentiating fingerprinting from other tracking techniques, such as, cookies, evercookies, HSTS-based tracking, etc.
       <br>
       - Why is it important?
         - Allowing services to recognize users in the absence of cookies (private mode does not help)
         - Benign use cases 
         - Differentiating bots from regular users
         - Detect an attacker who is logging in with stolen credentials
         - Somewhat abusive use cases
         - Tracking users without their consent across websites
       <br>
       - How does browser fingerprinting work?
         - Fingerprinting the JavaScript engine of a browser
         - Fingerprinting browser attributes (navigator and screen objects)
         - Fingerprinting the graphics card (canvas-based fingerprinting)
         - Fingerprinting the TLS stack
         - How the TLS handshake betrays the make of a client, regardless of what the client claims to be
       <br>
       - Putting it all together
         - How these attributes are combined into a fingerprint
         - How can the resulting fingerprints be used?
         - Are replay attacks an issue in browser fingerprinting? For example, can attackers, in the context of a phishing attack, steal a user's fingerprintable attributes along with their credentials and replay both to the targeted service?
       <br>
       - Reviewing countermeasures against fingerprinting
         - Browser-extension based
         - Blocking scripts vs. lying about the user's environment
         - Showing the limitations of browser extensions and how they can in fact worsen the problem
         - Privacy-first browsers
       <br>  
       - The future
         - Discussing where browsers seem to be going regarding browser fingerprinting
         - Differentiate between first-party fingerprinting that can be done for security (likely to stay) vs. third-party fingerprinting that works across sites (likely to go)
      <br>
       #### Hands-on Activities  
         - Trainer will provide a VirtualBox VM which will be equipped with local websites, browsers, browser extensions, packet-capturing tools, and packet-analysis tools. The participants in the training can use the VM to do all the hands-on activities.
         - Introduciton - Open up browser console, list navigator object, list screen object. Understand how the browser's identity is reflected in its native objects
         - Getting warmer - Visit a website (that the trainer will setup) that fingerprints the user and lists the extracted attributes. Understand everything that's being fingerprinted. Try out the private mode in your browser and see if it changes anything regarding your fingerprint (hint - it doesn't)
         - Somewhat Technical. Command-line activities and Wireshark activities - Use tcpdump and Wireshark to observe the TLS handshake between your browser and an HTTPS-enabled web server. Repeat the process with another browser and with a command-line tool (e.g. wget or curl). Observe how the handshake (namely the list of ciphersuites supported by the client change with each browser). Understand how, even without JavaScript and before the very first byte of HTTPS content, a web server can know if a client is lying about its identity.
         - Evaluate countermeasures - Turn on browser extensions that claim to protect against browser fingerprinting. View their effects on our previous fingerprinting page. Understand how dedicated sites can expose the real identity of a browser using forgotten DOM artifacts, partial spoofing of the tell-tale properties by the extension, and JavaScript tricks (like requesting the printing (toString) of a native function, that can uncover whether that function is hijacked by the extension)

  Title: "Snakes Crawling On The Web: Finding Security Vulnerabilities With Python (1-day training course)"
  URL: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-appsec-us-2021-virtual-training-tickets-188589806187
  SectionId: sku_SCOTW
  Description: >- 
      This training is focused on finding web app security vulnerabilities automatically through the use of highly effective tools which will be developed in the course of this training.
      
      A vast spectrum of topics will be explained, ranging from foundational ones and then moving up to esoteric vulnerabilities that are realtively new which usually remain undetected. The main objective is to write scripts at a very high speed that perform almost every stage of a web security assessment methodology using not well-known tricks which aren't implemented in the tools that are used the most, including types of attacks that are still not wide-spread, certainly not massively known and very dangerous (mentioned further on the outline).
 
      The language that will be used for building this arsenal of tools will be Python, because of the fact that this language helps to write very clear code and it is very easy to comprehend.
      These utilities are completely original and more capable than the public and commercial ones, with the advantage that they will be easily extendible by yourselves. The few already public tools that are way too powerful won't be reinvented, but definitely covered in the explanations.
 
      If you already know Python, this workshop is perfect for you, because the time taken to explain the language will be practically null because these tools are practically self-explanatory, thus you will be able to use your time in developing utilities that will boost up the speed and flow of your daily work.

 
      If you do not know Python, this training is also perfect for you - the language will be quickly, briefly and intuitively explained from a hacker perspective in order to develop scripts that you for sure will be using in your every-day work. The explanations will be the very same tools that will be developed in the training, all of this to have a better flow of how the training will advance. It will be extremely simple to learn it just by reading the code.
 
      If you already have experience in web app security, this workshop might still be worthy of you attention because of the methods not yet widely popularly known detailed further in the outline, and none of them can be found in any book just yet. Original techniques will be explained. Furthermore, most of the time will be used to construct the pieces of your very own framework to accomplish web security assessments.
 
      Do not forget this will be a long session. It is recommended to bring 0xC0FFEE.

  SectionId: sku_TMAMC
  Description: >-
      This advanced course in threat modeling is designed to give skilled practitioners a chance to hone and enhance their already existing skills with one of the leading thinkers on the subject.<br> The course 
      will be a mix of the three Jenga block types: technical, organizational and interpersonal, and include specifics based on student requests. The course will include both exercises, critiques and a seminar portion. 
      Students will be offered the chance to bring a real, anonymized model for critiques. Students who are familiar with multiple techniques for threat modeling will do best. (For example, DFDs and state machines; STRIDE, 
      kill chains and attack trees.)
      
      ### Outline:
      
       - 9am-10am The Jenga model of threat modeling is a way of conceptualizing and differentiating between the many skills we bring to bear in threat modeling, and being able to use it to categorize problems will be a base for the rest of the class. Samples and discussion.
       - 10am-12pm Critiques of threat models students bring
       - 12pm-1pm Lunch
       - 1pm-2pm Technical skill advanced topics, probably including some of threat modeling for conflict (trolling, computational propaganda, offensive content), IPV, comparative kill chain issues

  Description: >- 
      This hands-on introductory course in threat modeling is designed to bring students from no formal threat modeling knowledge to being able to provide structured, systematic, and comprehensive analysis of new or existing technology designs.
  
      ### Outline:
     
        - This course starts by introducting the Four Question Framework for threat modeling
          - 1 What are we working on?
          - 2 What can go wrong?
          - 3 What are we going to do about it?
          - 4 Did we do a good job?
        - The course then teaches students specific skills to provide structure for answering each. The students will be provided a sample system for analysis, craft Data Flow Diagrams to show what's being worked on, use STRIDE to find what can go wrong, discuss simple and complex mitigations to address those problems, and retrospectives to decide if they've done a good enough job.
        - (Not including breaks in the outline for simplicity)
        - 9am-10am Threat modeling intro - threat modeling a home, threat modeling a technical system
        - 10am-11am Getting structured - the 4 question frame, and its informal use
        - 11am-12pm What are we working on? What's a DFD? What makes one good? Draw one, peer review, discuss. (Each segment follows the explanation, apply, review and discuss cycle for effective education.)
        - 12pm-1pm Lunch
        - 1pm-2:30pm STRIDE and its applicationn. What is STRIDE? Find threats with STRIDE.
        - 2:30pm-3:30pm Mitigations - What are mitigations? What sorts of controls do we need? Why controls are a better frame than risk management or scoring.
        - 3:30pm-4:30pm Retrospectives and selling threat modeling
        - 4:30pm-5pm Close
