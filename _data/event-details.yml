    Global AppSec US Virtual 2021 returns Nov. 8-12, 2021. Designed for private and public sector infosec professionals, the two day OWASP conferences equip developers, defenders, and advocates to build a more secure web.  We are offering educational 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day training courses on November 8-10. 
    Join us for leading application security technologies, speakers, prospects, and community, in a unique event that will build on everything you already know to expect from an OWASP Global Conference.
